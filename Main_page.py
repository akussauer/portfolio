st.write("""
        Welcome to my portfolio! I am a sports performance analyst with a passion for data analysis and sports performance. 
        I have a strong background in kinesiology, taking my BA at Vancouver Island University, and have pursued various certifications in strength and conditioning, sports nutrition, and coaching.
        I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Sports Performance Analytics at the University of Chester, where I am further honing my skills in data analysis and visualization. 
        Recently, I have been working as a performance analyst for AquaticsGB, where I have been involved in notational analysis of swimming competitions and developing custom data management and visualization programs.
        In my own time, I enjoy resistance training, eating good food, and spending time with my family and friends.
