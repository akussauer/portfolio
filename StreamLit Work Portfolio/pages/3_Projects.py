This project involves using multiple regression and machine learning to predict swimming performance based on historical data. 
The goal is to predict swimmer performance in the 100m freestyle relay event based on recent meet data. 
The program is designed to be flexible and compatible with raw outputs from the AquaticsGB database, allowing it to be used for any event. 
This project is currently in development and expected to be completed by August 2025. It aims to help coaches and training staff estimate performance-related metrics and simulate theoretical races.
